# Raspberry Pi OpenVPN Project

This project demonstrates how to set up a secure OpenVPN server on a Raspberry Pi, enabling encrypted remote access to your home or private network.

---

## Project Overview

- **OpenVPN server** runs on a Raspberry Pi device.  
- Clients connect securely using certificates and keys.  
- VPN provides safe access to your local network from anywhere, protecting data privacy and security.

---

## Repository Contents

- `client.ovpn` – Example OpenVPN client configuration file (without real certificates and keys for security).  
- `README.md` – This file with project description and setup instructions.

---

## Setup Instructions
Set up the OpenVPN server on your Raspberry Pi (see external tutorial or project guide).

Generate certificates and keys securely using EasyRSA or a similar tool.

Configure your client by replacing placeholders in client.ovpn with your certificates and server IP.

Connect to VPN using an OpenVPN client application.

Test the connection by pinging devices on your private network or checking your IP address.

Security Notes
Never commit real private keys or certificates to public repositories.

Use .gitignore to exclude sensitive files.

Always keep your Raspberry Pi updated for security patches.

## Client Configuration Example
Replace placeholders with your actual server IP and certificates before use:

```conf
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote YOUR_SERVER_IP 1194            # Replace with your VPN server IP address
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
remote-cert-tls server
cipher AES-256-CBC
verb 3

<ca>
# Insert your CA certificate here
</ca>

<cert>
# Insert your client certificate here
</cert>

<key>
# Insert your client key here
</key>
```

## Explanation of Certificates and Keys
When setting up OpenVPN, you will see configuration sections like this in your client .ovpn file:

<ca>
# Insert your CA certificate here
</ca>

<ca> — This section contains the CA certificate (ca.crt).
The Certificate Authority (CA) is the trusted entity that signs and verifies all certificates. This certificate helps your client verify the VPN server’s identity.
Important: The CA certificate is the same for all clients because it is the root of trust for your VPN network.

<cert>
# Insert your client certificate here
</cert>

<cert> — This section contains the client certificate (client.crt).
This certificate identifies your client device and proves its identity to the VPN server.
Each client has a unique client certificate to distinguish it from others.

<key>
# Insert your client key here
</key>

<key> — This section contains the client private key (client.key).
This private key is unique to your client and must be kept secret. It is used to establish secure encrypted communication with the server.

## Other important files you will encounter:

server.crt / server.key — The server’s certificate and private key, used to identify and authenticate the VPN server.
ta.key — TLS authentication key, an additional security layer to prevent unauthorized connectio
