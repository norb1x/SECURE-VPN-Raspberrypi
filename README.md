# Raspberry Pi OpenVPN Project

This project demonstrates how to set up a secure OpenVPN server on a Raspberry Pi, enabling encrypted remote access to your home or private network.

---

## Project Overview

- **OpenVPN server** runs on a Raspberry Pi device.  
- Clients connect securely using certificates and keys.  
- VPN provides safe access to your local network from anywhere, protecting data privacy and security.

---

## Repository Contents

- `client.ovpn` – Example OpenVPN client configuration file (without real certificates and keys for security).  
- `README.md` – This file with project description and setup instructions.

---

## Client Configuration Example

Replace placeholders with your actual server IP and certificates before use:

```conf
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote YOUR_SERVER_IP 1194            # Replace with your VPN server IP address
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
remote-cert-tls server
cipher AES-256-CBC
verb 3

<ca>
# Insert your CA certificate here
</ca>

<cert>
# Insert your client certificate here
</cert>

<key>
# Insert your client key here
</key>


Setup Instructions
Set up the OpenVPN server on your Raspberry Pi (see external tutorial or project guide).

Generate certificates and keys securely using EasyRSA or a similar tool.

Configure your client by replacing placeholders in client.ovpn with your certificates and server IP.

Connect to VPN using an OpenVPN client application.

Test the connection by pinging devices on your private network or checking your IP address.

Security Notes
Never commit real private keys or certificates to public repositories.

Use .gitignore to exclude sensitive files.

Always keep your Raspberry Pi updated for security patches.
